# Getting Started
These instructions will help you get your E.U FET Resources copy up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


# Requirement
The project requires minimum Android API 21+ (5.0 Lollipop) SDK to test. I use Android Studio 3.4 for this.

# Test Run
Try cleaning and rebuilding the project in your programming environment, once you are done fixing any error (incase of one), you'll be ready to look into the project.



**A personal note:** `You all must keep up with programming. It's sometimes difficult and sometimes easy but fun afterall, you can create your own world with programming and that's the beauty of it. So, all the best for your next creation.`

This project is initially developed by **[Orengo Dickson](hhttps://github.com/dicksonorengo)**.
