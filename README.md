# E.U FET Resources


This project was written by Engineering Students
The app is intended to be used by student from Faculty of Engineering and technology Egerton University. The app consists  electronics (Arduino Programming, raspberry pi  ), mehanical project with diagram and detailed illustration, Website and App development, Computer troubleshooting (Window Installations and many more),Revision materials from other faculty, lost and found platform Engineering notes from year One to Five and many more. 
The goal of our life is, ‘Think different, Create difference and feel that difference’ transforming valuable thoughts into reality.

We are the students  of Agricultural, Mechanical, Civil and Electrical  engineering in Egerton University Campus .

Learning through wide world of internet is not an easy task, and that also from high-profile notes is really difficult. So as a student we thought, being here, We could share what we learnt everyday  with  team and at the same time help many  students in Egerton University to explore the vast engineering world in simpler way.

Let us know how you feel about the content and any thing you would like us to cover in the future. We hope you enjoy the content on this App!
 
We are currently working very hard on **E.U FET RESOURCES APP** with ***⁩ **Engineer Brian**⁩ , **⁨Eng Kip⁩**   , **Eng Rick⁩** **⁨Eng Alfred**⁩ and 6 more members from different faculty . It will bring a lot of new features. 
stay tuned!

# Getting Started with free source code for learning purpose
These instructions will help you get your E.U FET Resources copy up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


# Requirement
The project requires minimum Android API 21+ (5.0 Lollipop) SDK to test. I use Android Studio 3.4 for this.

# Test Run
Try cleaning and rebuilding the project in your programming environment, once you are done fixing any error (incase of one), you'll be ready to look into the project.



**A personal note:** `You all must keep up with programming. It's sometimes difficult and sometimes easy but fun afterall, you can create your own world with programming and that's the beauty of it. So, all the best for your next creation.`

This project is initially developed by **[Orengo Dickson](hhttps://github.com/dicksonorengo)**.
