# Smart StudyRoom App 


This project was written by Dickson  Orengo
The app is intended to be used by student from Egerton University. The app consists  electronics (Arduino Programming, raspberry pi  ), mehanical project with diagram and detailed illustration, Website and App development, Computer troubleshooting (Window Installations and many more).
The goal of our life is, ‘Think different, Create difference and feel that difference’ transforming valuable thoughts into reality.

We are the students  of Agricultural, Mechanical, Civil and Electrical  engineering in Egerton University Campus .

Learning through wide world of internet is not an easy task, and that also from high-profile notes is really difficult. So as a student we thought, being here, We could share what we learnt everyday  with  team and at the same time help many  students in Egerton University to explore the vast engineering world in simpler way.

Let us know how you feel about the content and anything you would like us to cover in the future. We hope you enjoy the content on this App!
 
We are currently working very hard on **Smart StudyRoom APP** . It will bring a lot of new features. 
stay tuned!

**A personal note:** `You all must keep up with programming. It's sometimes difficult and sometimes easy but fun afterall, you can create your own world with programming and that's the beauty of it. So, all the best for your next creation.`
